I am a Ph.D student at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/mila/">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a> supervised by <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/">Yoshua Bengio</a> and <a href="https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/">Guillaume Lajoie</a>. I am interested in out-of-distribution generlization and modularity in memory-augmented neural networks.

Before starting my PhD at Mila, I have graduated from the University of Cambridge with a Master's degree in Pure Mathematics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos">Part III of the Math Tripos</a>) focussing on Probability Theory and Combinatorics, as well as from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles with a Bachelor's degree and Master's degree in Pure Mathematics focussing on Differential Geometry and Geometric Group Theory. More details can be found in my <a href="./pdf/CV.pdf">resume</a>.
